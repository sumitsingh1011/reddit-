## User Persona:  Urban, Tech-Savvy Millennial/Gen Z  with Existential Concerns

**Age Group:** 28-35 (most likely, but could potentially be younger Gen Z leaning heavily into tech).  This is inferred from the user's interest in relatively new technologies (Vision Pro, iOS development, spatial computing), a nostalgic reference to coming-of-age movies for Gen Z, but also the mention of "boomers and millennials" suggesting they are not part of either group. The references to childhood experiences and anxieties about aging, combined with established career (iOS developer) imply a position slightly older than a typical Gen Z user.
